What is SNS ?
:-Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service provided by AWS that enables you to send messages or notifications to a 
  variety of endpoints, such as email, SMS, HTTP/S, AWS Lambda, SQS queues, mobile push notifications, and more.

Why do we use SNS ?
:-SNS is used to decouple distributed systems by enabling communication between microservices, applications, and other AWS services. It simplifies the 
  implementation of event-driven architectures and allows for scalable and reliable message delivery.

What is an Amazon SNS function, and how we can configure it.
:-Amazon SNS functions by allowing you to create topics, to which you can subscribe endpoints or other AWS services. To configure SNS, you create a topic, set 
  up subscriptions to that topic (specifying the endpoint or service you want to receive messages), and then publish messages to the topic.

Difference between Amazon SNS & Amazon SQS.
:-While both Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS are messaging services offered by AWS, they serve different purposes. SNS is a push-based messaging system, where 
  messages are pushed to subscribers. SQS, on the other hand, is a pull-based message queuing service, where consumers pull messages from queues.

What are the different delivery formats and transports in AWS SNS ?
:-AWS SNS supports various delivery formats and transports, including:
  HTTP/HTTPS: Deliver messages to HTTP endpoints.
  Email: Send notifications via email.
  SMS: Send text messages to mobile devices.
  Amazon SQS: Publish messages to SQS queues.
  AWS Lambda: Invoke Lambda functions with messages.
  Mobile Push: Send push notifications to mobile devices.

What is the difference between SNS FIFO & Standard while creating the SNS topic.
:-FIFO topics in SNS ensure that messages are delivered exactly once and in the order they are sent. Standard topics do not guarantee message ordering or 
  exactly-once delivery.

On which services are configured with the AWS SNS ?
:-AWS SNS can be configured with various AWS services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, email, SMS, mobile push, and HTTP/S endpoints.

What is 10DLC in AWS ?
:-10DLC (10-Digit Long Code) is a messaging program that allows businesses to send A2P (Application-to-Person) SMS messages using local 10-digit long codes. 
  It's a method to send bulk SMS messages to customers.

What are FIFO topics on SNS ?
:-FIFO topics ensure that messages are delivered in the exact order they are sent and exactly once. This is useful for scenarios where message order and 
  reliability are critical, such as processing financial transactions.

What is SNS Mobile Push ?
:-SNS Mobile Push allows you to send push notifications to mobile devices (iOS, Android, Kindle Fire, etc.) through platform-specific messaging services 
  like Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) and Google Cloud Messaging (GCM).

On which delivery method do we use and configure the subscription ?
:-Subscriptions in SNS can be configured with various delivery protocols depending on the endpoint, such as HTTP, HTTPS, email, SMS, SQS, Lambda, and mobile 
  push. The appropriate delivery method is chosen based on the type of endpoint or service you want to receive messages.
