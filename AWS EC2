What is EC2, Why do we need EC2 service in cloud computing ?
:-Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual computers (instances) on which 
  to run their own applications. It provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, making it easier for developers to scale their computing resources as 
  needed. 
  Purpose of EC2 in Cloud Computing:
  Scalability: EC2 allows users to quickly scale their compute capacity up or down based on demand, ensuring that they have the resources they need when they 
  need them.
  Flexibility: Users can choose from a variety of instance types, operating systems, and software configurations to meet their specific requirements.
  Cost-Effectiveness: With EC2, users only pay for the compute capacity they use, making it a cost-effective solution compared to maintaining physical servers.
  Reliability: EC2 instances run on AWS's highly reliable infrastructure, providing high availability and fault tolerance.
  Elasticity: EC2 instances can be easily resized or terminated based on changing workload demands, providing elasticity to the infrastructure.

Features of Amazon EC2 ?
:-Virtual Machines (Instances): EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the form of virtual machines (instances) that can run a wide range of 
  applications.
  Variety of Instance Types: Users can choose from various instance types optimized for different use cases, such as compute-optimized, memory-optimized, 
  storage-optimized, etc.
  Flexible Pricing Options: EC2 offers various pricing options, including On-Demand, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances, allowing users to optimize 
  costs based on their usage patterns.
  Elastic Block Store (EBS): EC2 instances can be attached to durable block storage volumes called Elastic Block Store (EBS), providing persistent storage 
  for data.
  Security: EC2 provides robust security features, including security groups, network access control lists (ACLs), and key pairs for SSH access.
  Auto Scaling: EC2 Auto Scaling allows users to automatically scale their EC2 capacity based on predefined conditions or metrics, ensuring that 
  applications can handle varying levels of traffic.
  Load Balancing: EC2 integrates with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), allowing users to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances for improved 
  availability and fault tolerance.

What is Hypervisor ? and its types ?
:-A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software layer that enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical 
  machine (host). It manages the virtualization of hardware resources, allowing each VM to operate as if it were running on its own dedicated hardware.
  Types of Hypervisors:
  Type 1 Hypervisor: Also known as a bare-metal hypervisor, it runs directly on the host's hardware without the need for a host operating system. Examples 
  include VMware vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.
  Type 2 Hypervisor: Also known as a hosted hypervisor, it runs on top of a host operating system. Examples include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, 
  and Parallels Desktop.use hypervisor
  Hypervisors are used in virtualization environments, such as data centers, cloud computing platforms, and desktop virtualization solutions, to consolidate 
  physical hardware resources and efficiently utilize computing resources.

Steps to create an EC2 instance.
:-Log in to the AWS Management Console.
  Navigate to the EC2 service.
  Click on "Launch Instance" to start the instance creation wizard.
  Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use as the base for your instance.
  Select an instance type based on your resource requirements.
  Configure instance details, such as network settings, storage options, and security groups.
  Optionally, add tags to identify your instance.
  Review and launch the instance.

EC2 Instance state ?
:-The state of an EC2 instance indicates its current operational status. The common EC2 instance states include:
  Pending: The instance is being launched or started.
  Running: The instance is up and running.
  Stopped: The instance is stopped but retains its configuration and data.
  Terminated: The instance has been permanently deleted.

How many types of EC2 Instance-State codes ?
:-There are several instance-state codes associated with EC2 instances, including pending (0), running (16), shutting down (32), terminated (48), 
stopping (64), and stopped (80).

What is the meaning of server hibernating mode ?
:-Server hibernating mode refers to a state where an EC2 instance is stopped but retains its configuration and data in persistent storage (e.g., EBS 
  volumes). When an instance is in hibernating mode, it can be quickly resumed to its previous state without needing to reinitialize the operating system or 
  applications. This helps to reduce startup time and maintain the continuity of running services.
